       <h3>DUMBBELL SQUAT TO PRESS</h3>
	       <ul>
		       <li>Begin in a standing position with a dumbbell in each hand</li>
		       <li>Clean the dumbbells to shoulder height utilizing a jumping motion and shoulder rotation</li>
		       <li>Palms should be facing each other and elbows should be pointing forward</li>
		       <li>Look directly forward, keep your chest up, and place feet about shoulder-width apart</li>
		       <li>Initiate movement with a squat, flexing the knees and hips to lower your body</li>
		       <li>Descend as far as flexibility allows, maintaining good posture in the spine, hips, and knees</li>
		       <li>Pause for a brief moment at the bottom of the squat before returning to a standing position by extending the hips and knees</li>
		       <li>After fully rising to a standing position, press the weights overhead by extending the elbows and flexing at the shoulder</li>
		       <li>Return the weights to the shoulder before repeating the whole movement for 15 repetitions</li>
		</ul>
	       
	   <h3>LANDMINE SQUAT PRESS</h3>
	       <ul>
		       <li>Stand holding the weighted end of the barbell with both hands in front of your chest</li>
		       <li>Your feet should be level and shoulder-width apart</li>
		       <li>Press the weight up with both hands until your arms are extended, then bring it back down slowly</li>
		       <li>Adopt a split stance, with the opposite leg to the arm you are lifting with forwards</li>
		       <li>Press the weight up with one arm, keeping it in line with your shoulder rather than moving it towards the middle of your body</li>
		</ul>
	       
	       <h3>SUMO SQUAT</h3>
	       <ul>
		       <li>Start in a standing position, take your feet out sideways so that they are wider than shoulder width and toes turned out slightly</li>
		       <li>Bring your hands up into a prayer position on your chest</li>
		       <li>Sit your hips back and down, then bend your knees, keeping them in line with your toes</li>
		       <li>Make sure you keep your chest up and don't tip forwards</li>
		       <li>Lower down until your hips are the same height as your knees, then push down into your heels</li>
		       <li>Contract your glutes and quadriceps to return to the standing position</li>
		       <li>Do for 20 reps</li>
